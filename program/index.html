    <h4>Nicholas Maton: Skyrmions - Shapes and Dynamics</h4>

    This talk is on two Skyrmion topics. 1. Based on an analysis of the small $r$ and large $r$ asymptotics of the $B=1$ hedgehog Skyrmion profile $f(r)$, I propose a universal profile (up to a scale) with continuous curvature. This could be useful as an approximation for Skyrmions in general pion EFTs, including those with higher-order space- and time-derivatives. 2. I draw attention to two important and well-known nuclear reactions, involving Nitrogen-14 and Boron-10, and suggest that they are worth studying through numerical Skyrmion collisions.

    <h4>Katarzyna Sławińska: Amplitude modulations and resonant decay of excited oscillons</h4>

    We show that the decay of strongly excited oscillons in a single vacuum model reveals a chaotic, fractal-like pattern very much like one found in kink-antikink collision in the \phi^4 model. This structure can be attributed to the resonant energy transfer mechanism triggered by the modulations of amplitudes of constituent oscillons which form the excited oscillon. We also find evidence that such modulations arise as a motion of two quasi-breathers inside the constituent oscillon.

    <h4>Jarah Evslin: Quantum kink - meson Scattering</h4>

    <h4>Kinga Gawrych: Circumventing Derrick's Theorem - Constructing topological solitons in Electroweak Theory
    </h4>

    It is well known that instantons give rise to baryon-number-violating interactions in the Standard Model (SM). However, in electroweak (EW) theory, the presence of the Higgs field breaks the scale invariance, and, by Derrick's Theorem, instantons cease to exist in the EW sector. It was speculated that some approximate constrained instanton solutions still exist and give a non-negligible contribution to the path integral. Such solutions would give rise to a new source of baryon number violation in the SM. In this talk, I will discuss how to bypass Derrick's Theorem and construct the constrained instanton configurations in the EW sector. I will also demonstrate the existence of constrained instantons in a simple toy model by presenting specific examples of such solutions.

    <h4>Stefano Bolognesi: The monopole-fermion problem in a chiral gauge theory
    </h4>

    The scattering of electrically charged fermions on magnetic monopole leads to the Callan-Rubakov problem. We discuss some aspects of this problem for Abelian gauge theories with chiral fermions in a Dirac monopole background. In some cases, it is possible to embed the theory in a non-Abelian gauge theory where the monopole is regularized as a 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole. One theory of this kind is the SU(N) chiral gauge theory with fermions in the symmetric, anti-antisymmetric and anti-fundamental representations. We examine this model in detail and provide a possible solution for the condensates around the monopole, the symmetry preserving boundary conditions, and discuss the particle scattering problem. We discuss in general the problem of the fractional OUT states, sometimes called semiton problem in the GUT model, how it emerges in our model, and what are the proposals for the solution.

    <h4>Yakov Shnir: Self-gravitating monopoles and Skyrmions with localized fermions
    </h4>

    Fermionic modes localized on solitons are discussed. We construct self-consistent solutions of the corresponding system of coupled
integral-differential equations and study dependencies of solitons and
normalizable fermion bound states on the values of the parameters of the
model. In particular, we consider solutions of (1+1)-dimensional scalar
models with self-interaction potentials and the fermionic modes
localized by the Skyrmions and monopoles. Considering the effects of
gravity we study fermions localized on the static spherically symmetric
non-Abelian monopole in the Einstein-Dirac-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory and
on the self-gravitating Skyrmion and discuss how the corresponding
spectral flows depend on the effective gravitational coupling constant.

    <h4>Maximilian Bachmaier: The slingshot effect: Scattering monopoles from Coulomb into the confining vacuum
    </h4>

    The slingshot effect describes magnetic monopoles traversing the boundary between Coulomb and confining phases.
This passage causes the gauge field to be confined in a cosmic string connected to the domain wall separating the two phases.
I will present the results of our numerical simulations.

Furthermore, since this phenomenon could be important for first-order phase transitions in the early universe, it may give significant imprints to cosmology.
Here I will discuss the characteristics of the gravitational radiation emitted during a single slingshot effect.

    <h4>Alberto García Martín-Caro: Moduli space dynamics of near extremal black holes
    </h4>

    <h4>Jaime Mendizabal: Hyper-Kähler moduli spaces of monopoles with arbitrary symmetry breaking
    </h4>

    <h4>Sergey Cherkis: Gravitational instantons as monopole moduli spaces
    </h4>

    Among all gravitational instantons, we focus on those that are complete hyperkaehler four-manifolds, also called tesserons.  We aim to realize each tesseron as a monopole moduli space.  Using this realization we get a convenient description of the parameter space of all tesserons, with each type (ALE, ALF, ALG/ALG*, and ALH/ALH*) appearing as a stratum in that parameter space.

    <h4>Andy Royston: Solitons and the extended Bogomolny equations with jumping data
    </h4>

    The extended Bogomolny equations are a system of PDE's for a connection and a triplet of Higgs fields on a three-dimensional space.  They are a hybrid of the Bogomolny equations and the Nahm equations.  After reviewing how these latter systems arise in the study of magnetic monopoles, I will present an energy functional for which solutions of the extended Bogomolny equations are minimizers in a fixed topological class.  In this construction, the connection and Higgs triplet are defined on all of R^3 and couple to additional dynamical fields localized on a two-plane that are analogous to jumping data in the Nahm equations.  Solutions can therefore be interpreted as finite-energy BPS solitons in a three-dimensional theory with a planar defect.  This talk is based on work done in collaboration with Sophia Domokos.

    <h4>Harry Braden: Monopoles with symmetry
    </h4>

    I will describe some old and new results for su(2) Euclidean BPS monopoles with symmetry
reporting on joint work with Linden Disney-Hogg.

    <h4>Christopher Lang: Instantons with continuous symmetries
    </h4>

    In this talk, we use a theorem regarding fixed points on moduli spaces to study instantons with continuous symmetries. In doing so, we find linear constraints for these symmetric instantons, which both greatly simplify the non-linear constraints that instantons satisfy and reduce the problem to representation theory. Moreover, we analyze the connection between these instantons and other gauge theoretic objects, identify novel instantons with higher rank structure groups, and even find all instantons with certain conformal symmetries.

    <h4>Paul Sutcliffe: Skyrmions and ADHM
    </h4>

    The ADHM construction provides a method that requires only linear algebra to obtain Yang-Mills instantons from quaternionic matrix data. A similar construction to obtain approximate Skyrmions will be discussed.

    <h4>Josh Cork: Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints from ADHM data and rational maps
    </h4>

    A key step in quantisation of the Skyrme model is to constrain the wavefunction; this in order to calculate possible spin/isospin quantum numbers of nuclei. Mathematically these constraints arise due to the nontriviality of the fundamental group $\mathbb{Z}_2$ of configuration space Maps$_N(S^3,S^3)$, with the action of a loop on the wavefunction leading to a sign, and thus a constraint. These are called Finkelstein-Rubinstein (FR) constraints. Various  methods are known for calculating these in limited scenarios (such as product Skyrme fields, or loops arising from symmetries of rational maps), but in order to extract more meaningful quantum effects, more sophisticated families of Skyrme fields are required. In this talk we shall present new (and remarkably simple) methods for calculating FR constraints for any Skyrme field generated from two popular and powerful schemes: instanton ADHM data, and rational maps.

    <h4>Benoit Charbonneau: Lowest charge symmetric instantons
    </h4>

    <h4>Maciej Dunajski: Twistor theory of Chen-Teo instantons
    </h4>

    Toric Ricci--flat metrics in dimension four correspond to certain holomorphic vector bundles over a twistor space. We construct these bundles explicitly, by exhibiting and characterising their patching matrices, for the five--parameter family of Riemannian ALF metrics constructed by Chen and Teo. The Chen--Teo family contains a two--parameter family of asymptotically flat gravitational instantons. The patching matrices for these instantons take a simple rational form.
This is based on a joint work with Paul Tod https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08170

    <h4>Tathagata Ghosh: Instantons and monopoles in dimensions 7 and 8
    </h4>

    In this talk I will gently introduce the notion of Yang--Mills instantons in higher dimensions, in particular, in dimensions 7 and 8. I will also briefly discuss the current research in this area, including my own, and how it fits into the bigger picture.
After reviewing the 4-dimensional instantons, I will discuss the main physical motivations behind higher dimensional instantons, by following the historical development of the subject. Then, I will introduce G\"unaydin--Nicolai instantons and Fairlie-Nuyts-Fubini-Nicolai (FNFN) instantons on $\mathbb{R}^7$ and $\mathbb{R}^8$ respectively. These are the earliest examples of instantons in dimensions 7 and 8 respectively, analogous to the BPST instantons on $\mathbb{R}^4$.
Finally, I will briefly explain how my own research on the deformation theory of instantons on asymptotically conical manifolds can provide many important properties of these instantons.
Following the spirit of the theme of the conference, in my talk, I will also very briefly describe the (very new) notion of monopoles in dimension 7.

    <h4>Ragini Singhal: Instantons on nearly parallel G2 manifolds
    </h4>

    We will formulate the deformation theory of G_2-instantons on nearly G_2 manifolds. There is a one-to-one correspondence between nearly parallel  G_2  structures and real Killing spinors, thus the deformation theory can be formulated in terms of spinors and Dirac operators. We prove that the space of infinitesimal deformations of an instanton is isomorphic to the kernel of an elliptic operator. Using this formulation we prove that abelian instantons are rigid. Then we apply our results to describe the deformation space of the canonical connection on the four normal homogeneous nearly G_2 manifolds. 

    <h4>Theodora Ioannidou: The SU(2) Lie-Poisson algebra & Its descendants
    </h4>

    Novel discrete algebra is presented which follows by combining the SU(2) Lie-Poisson bracket with the discrete Frenet equation. Physically, the construction describes a discrete piecewise linear string in R^3. The starting point of our derivation is the discrete Frenet frame assigned at each vertex of the string. Then the link vector that connects the neighboring vertices is assigned the SU(2) Lie-Poisson bracket. Moreover, the same bracket defines the transfer matrices of the discrete Frenet equation which relates two neighboring frames along the string. The procedure extends in a self-similar manner to an infinite hierarchy of Poisson structures. As an example, the first descendant of the SU(2) Lie-Poisson structure is presented in detail. For this, the spinor representation of the discrete Frenet equation is employed, as it converts the brackets into a computationally more manageable form. The final result is a nonlinear, nontrivial, and novel Poisson structure that engages four neighboring vertices.

    <h4>Luis Alvarez-Consul: Gravitating vortices and symplectic reduction by stages
    </h4>

    I will explain an approach to study gravitating vortices based
on finite-energy pluripotential theory, as recently applied to constant
scalar curvature Kähler metrics, combined with symplectic reduction by
stages. The gravitating vortices I will consider are solutions to
self-dual Einstein-Maxwell-Higgs equations coupling a Kähler metric on a
compact Riemann surface with a hermitian metric on a holomorphic line
bundle equipped with a fixed global section, in the critical Bogomol'nyi
phase. As an application, we obtain GIT polystability of the effective
divisor defined by the zeroes of the Higgs field as an algebro-geometric
obstruction to the existence of gravitating vortices on the 2-sphere, and
find new existence and uniqueness results in positive genus. This is joint
work with Mario Garcia-Fernandez, Oscar Garcia-Prada, Vamsi Pritham
Pingali and Chengjian Yao (arXiv:2406.03639).

    <h4>Andrzej Wereszczynski: Collective coordinate model for BPS 2-vortex with shape mode
    </h4>

    <h4>Nora Gavrea: Multi-vortices from the Sinh-Gordon and Tzitzeica equations
    </h4>

    We construct multi-vortices arising as radial solutions to the elliptic sinh-Gordon and Tzitzeica equations. These can be interpreted as abelian vortices on certain surfaces of revolution. These surfaces have a conical excess angle at infinity, and thus they cannot be embedded in the Euclidean 3-space. We show that they can be globally embedded in the hyperbolic space. The existence of these hyperbolic embeddings follows from the asymptotic analysis of a Painleve III ODE.

    <h4>Nuno Romão: Vortex moduli in toric fibre bundles
    </h4>

    I will describe moduli spaces of abelian vortices, targeted in any compact Kähler toric manifold $X$, on a compact Kähler manifold of arbitrary complex dimension.  A key step for this result is the proof of a 20-year-old conjecture by J. Baptista (established by him and other authors for $X=\mathbb{P}^n$) concerning an identification of moduli between linear and nonlinear vortices.  This is joint work with Marcel Bökstedt.

    <h4>Bernd Schroers: Geometry and dynamics of chiral magnetic Skyrmions
    </h4>

    <h4>Claire Cisowski: Paraxial optical skyrmions
    </h4>

    The observation of topological skyrmionics structures in evanescent electromagnetic fields in 2018 has prompted the emergence of a new line of research in optics. Powerful analogies can be drawn between non-trivial topologies of matter and light, from defect formation and annihilation in structured light fields to the emergence of geometric phases. Research on optical skyrmions is still in its infancy, and while initial works have focused on emulating the "baby-skyrmion" textures found in magnetism using the polarization degree of freedom of light, recent developments indicate that the full potential of optical skyrmions has yet to be realized. In this presentation, I will give a state-of-the-art overview of optical skyrmion research and will discuss how these structures are generated and characterized experimentally.

    <h4>Christoph Adam: Skyrme Crystals, Nuclear Matter and Compact Stars
    </h4>

    In this talk, a review of recent results on the different crystalline solutions of the Skyrme model and some of its generalizations is presented.  We also discuss the application of these Skyrme crystals to the study of cold nuclear matter at finite density, and the resulting neutron stars.  We highlight both the improved results for dense nuclear matter implied by this recent progress and some of the open questions and problems which still must be resolved for a completely satisfactory description of nuclear matter within the Skyrme model framework.
