    <h2>About the conference</h2>



    <p>
        This years geometric models of matter (GMoM) conference will be held at the University of Leeds from 19th to 22nd August. The theme for the conference is intentionally broad, focussing on topological solitons and their applications in physics. While talks can be on anything within this loose brief, each iteration of GMoM has a different focus. In celebration of the 50 year anniversary of <a href="monopoles/index.html">monopoles in gauge theory</a>, this year the focus will be topological solitons and gauge theory.
    </p>



    <p>
        All talks will be held in the Maths Department in the MALL on level 8. This is intended to be an in-person event and hence in-person speakers will be given priority. If you cannot attend in-person, all talks will be streamed online and uploaded to be watched at your convenience. Additional information is available through the above links that should contain everything you need to know. If you have any further questions don't hesitate to drop us an <a href="mailto:twinyard@ed.ac.uk">email</a>.
    </p>



    <h2> Registration </h2>
      <p>
      To register for the event please fill out the form at <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/eQDC2a0MWh?origin=lprLink">https://forms.office.com/e/eQDC2a0MWh?origin=lprLink</a>. Registration costs £50, to be paid separately to completing the form; this may be done by following the link <a href="https://store.leeds.ac.uk/product-catalogue/faculty-of-maths-physical-science/maths">https://store.leeds.ac.uk/product-catalogue/faculty-of-maths-physical-science/maths</a>. 
      If you would like to give a talk at the conference, you will have the opportunity to submit a title for consideration when completing the registration form. Please note that titles must be submitted by the end of April to be considered.
      If you would like to request any support with the costs associated with the conference, or have any questions about registration, just drop the organisers an email at <a href="mailto:twinyard@ed.ac.uk">twinyard@ed.ac.uk</a>. We look forward to seeing you all in Leeds soon.
