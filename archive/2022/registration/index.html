    <h2> Accommodation booking </h2>

    <p>
      To book accommodation, first make sure you have registered by sending me an email at <a href="mailto:t.winyard@kent.ac.uk">t.winyard@kent.ac.uk</a>. Then if you want accommodation on campus, you can use the
      link
      <a href="https://kenthospitality.kent.ac.uk/KxBnB/"> https://kenthospitality.kent.ac.uk/KxBnB/</a>. You need to enter the promotion code (which was sent via email) in the box to show availability. There will be no availability showing unless the promotion code is added.
      If you didn't get a code or can't find it in your emails just drop me an email and I will send it to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to arrange your own accomodation that is ok, just make sure you have let me know via email that you will be attending but do not require conference accommodation.
    </p>
    <p>
        All accommodation is en-suite with a double bed and will be situated in Tyler Court Block B. Note that breakfast is included and
        will be served in the Rutherford dinning hall (just across the road). Note that, unfortunately we cannot offer family rooms at this
        time, though there is plenty of accomodation available in the centre of Canterbury that should fit your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do have some limited funds to support attendees from the UK or Europe. This will be given out on a first come first served
        basis, so make sure you let me know if you need financial assistance.
