    <h2> Registration </h2>

    <p>
        Currently to register for the event just drop me an email at <a href="mailto:t.winyard@kent.ac.uk">t.winyard@kent.ac.uk</a>.
        Soon a link will appear here to allow you to book acomodation at the University for the event. If you wish to arrange your
        own accomodation that is ok, just make sure you have let me know via email that you will be attending and you are all set.
    </p>
    <p>
        All acomodation is en-suite with a double bed and will be situated in Tyler Court Block B. Note that breakfast is included and
        will be served in the Rutherford dinning hall (just across the road). Note that, unfortunately we cannot offer family rooms at this
        time, though there is plenty of accomodation available in the centre of Canterbury that should fit your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do have some limited funds to support attendees from the UK or Europe. This will be given out on a first come first served
        basis, so make sure you let me know if you need financial assistance.
