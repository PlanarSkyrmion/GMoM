    <h2>Ways to get to campus</h2>
    <p>
      <ol class="customIndentOne">
      <li> <b>Train:</b> You will most likely arrive at Canterbury West, which is connected to London via HS1, Canterbury East is slightly further out but there is a direct bus.
      </li>
      <ul class="customIndentTwo" style="list-style-type: circle">
        <li> <b>To walk From Canterbury West:</b> takes about 30mins, but is uphill. Turn left out of the main exit and walk past the small roundabout, then take the footpath on your left under the tracks.  You will reach a park where you immediately turn left, following the foot path straight on until it finishes on Beaconsfield road. Turn right and take the next left onto St Michaels rd, keep going straight (through a pedestrianised break), the road becomes Salisbury rd then take the next right onto Lyndhurst Cl and soon you will see a footpath going up hill.  Follow the footpath to the University.  The end of the footpath is marked on the map below.
        </li><br>
        <li> <b>To get the bus from Canterbury West:</b> turn right out of the station exit and walk to the end of the road.  Turn left at the roundabout and about 60 metres down the road you will see a bus stop on the far side of the street from the station.  From here you can get one of the buses mentioned below (going uphill).
        </li><br>
        <li> <b>To walk From Canterbury East:</b> takes about 50mins, you must find your way to Canterbury West station first and then follow the directions from there.
        </li><br>
      	<li> <b>To get the bus from Canterbury East:</b> exit through the main exit onto station road and turn right (east), you will walk past the station car park.  As you approach the main road you will see the bus stop. From here you can get one of the buses mentioned below.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br>
        <li> <b>Bus:</b> The university is served by two main bus routes,  the Uni 1 bus comes around every 30 mins and starts at the bus station. If you get off at Darwin college (the last stop), this is across the road from Cornwallis east where the talks take place. If you take the Uni 2 you will have to get off at Keynes college on the other side of campus.
          Details of the two bus routes can be found <a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/transport/commute-smarter/bus-travel/stagecoach-buses"> [here] </a>.
        </li><br>
        <li> <b>Car:</b> There is a lot of parking on campus, though this fills up fast in the middle of the day and you may have to park a little further from your destination.  There is parking off Darwin road near the accommodation, if this is full try the Giles lane car park which is bigger.
